  abstract = 	 {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.}

abstract="Birds-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is critical for autonomous driving for its powerful spatial representation ability. It is challenging to estimate the BEV semantic maps from monocular images due to the spatial gap, since it is implicitly required to realize both the perspective-to-BEV transformation and segmentation. We present a novel two-stage Geometry PrIor-based Transformation framework named GitNet, consisting of (i) the geometry-guided pre-alignment and (ii) ray-based transformer. In the first stage, we decouple the BEV segmentation into the perspective image segmentation and geometric prior-based mapping, with explicit supervision by projecting the BEV semantic labels onto the image plane to learn visibility-aware features and learnable geometry to translate into BEV space. Second, the pre-aligned coarse BEV features are further deformed by ray-based transformers to take visibility knowledge into account. GitNet achieves the leading performance on the challenging nuScenes and Argoverse Datasets.",

abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for generating birdâs eye video from egocentric RGB videos. Working with egocentric views is tricky since such the view is highly warped and prone to occlusions. On the other hand, a birdâs eye view has a consistent scaling in at least the two dimensions it shows. Moreover, most of the state-of-the-art systems for tasks such as path prediction are built for birdâs eye views of the subjects. We present a deep learning-based approach that transfers the egocentric RGB images captured from a dashcam of a car to birdâs eye view. This is a task of view translation, and we perform two experiments. The first one uses an image-to-image translation method, and the other uses a video-to-video translation. We compare the results of our work with homographic transformation, and our SSIM values are better by a margin of 77\% and 14.4\%, and the RMSE errors are lower by 40\% and 14.6\% for image-to-image translation and video-to-video translation, respectively. We also visually show the efficacy and limitations of each method with helpful insights for future research. Compared to previous works that use homography and LIDAR for 3D point clouds, our work is more generalizable and does not require any expensive equipment.},
